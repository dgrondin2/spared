		Instead of selling, throwing away, or storing unused items and supplies, post your<br/>
		surplus items on our item-offer board. Animal organizations will log in, search the<br/>
		board, and request the items they need. As a donor, you have complete control over<br/>
		who receives your donation. Organizations can also post their individual wishlists,<br/>
		which you can browse and then match your items directly.
